This is an example project for packaging a Replaceable Library Plugin (RLP) called `KrabbyPatty` with SwiftPM.

It includes an automated set of GitHub Actions workflows that build the RLP for four platforms (Ubuntu 24.04 (Swift Docker), Ubuntu 22.04 (Swift Docker), Amazon Linux 2 (Swift Docker), and macOS) and uploads them to AWS S3.
